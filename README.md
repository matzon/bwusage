#BWUsage

Small application for getting bandwidth usage from my isp.

_Quicker than messing with snmp on the router ;)_

Output stored in (in memory db, for now) hsqldb, using raw hibernate - no spring-data or jpa.

Will serve as basis for producing data for future graphing frontend - no rrd/backend!
